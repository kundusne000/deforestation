          Hi, my name is Sneha and this is my first ever website.  This website was made using CSS, HTML, and JS. My favorite thing on this website is the slider which took a lot of time! Some of my hobbies are gymnastics and swimming. I created this website so people are more aware of all of the problems deforestation causes. Raising awareness is one of the most important things one can do to help stop deforestation. My goal in creating this website is someone who has stumbled upon this website will leave the website having learned something about deforestation. I hope they leave and do something to help deforestation, even if their actions are small. Because if everyone took small actions, the world would be a better place and deforestation would be significantly decreased.
